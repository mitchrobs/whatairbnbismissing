                    <p>Don't get me wrong: I love Airbnb. </p>

                    <p>Airbnb has created a sense of belonging <i>all over the world.</i> It's given everyone the opportunity to travel like a local. It's a fantastic product.

                    <br>

                    <p>Through initiatives and features like #onelessstranger, Airbnb Open, and the Airbnb Groups, Airbnb has empowered hundreds of thousands of people to become hosts, entrepreneurs, and friends.</p>

                    <p>That all said, there's one feature in particular that is <strong>missing</strong> that could make a big impact. Airbnb has done an incredible job building resources and features for hosts, but...<p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="site-align-c"><strong>What features have strengthened the other side of Airbnb: the travelers?</strong></p>
                    <br />
                    
                    <p>Yes, the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/stories/memphis/from-guest-to-host">connection</a>  between a Airbnb host and guest is often special - but many potential users still don't feel that it replaces the experience of meeting up with other travelers. Hostels do this really well.</p>

                    <p>While the <i>hotel</i> industry has lost marketshare due to Airbnb, <i>Hostels</i> still have a strong competitive advantage: meeting fellow travelers that they can <i>explore</i> with and fulfill their sense of wunderlust.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wehostels">Other</a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hostelworld-com">companies</a> are picking up on this advantage, too. Airbnb already provides travelers with a local, unique expeierence, but doesn't excel in this (crucial) area. 

                    <p> Luckily the solution here is straighforward, but, like anything, is <i>sensitive</i> on the execution.
                    <br><br>

                    It could help create a <i>much</i> higher lifetime value for airbnb customers. It could even <i>double</i> the booking rate for users that are looking for longing for something like this <i>(and there are plenty)</i>.<br><br> There's a lot of value in building a strong culture.

                    <h1 class="site-align-c">The solution:</h1>
                    <br />
                
                     Give Airbnb guests the same great network to travel with as hosts have recieved, while still making it feel like a natural part of the user exeperience. <br><br>

                     Kind of like a travel <strong>Caravan</strong>, or an Aribnb "group" for travelers, that activates when a user makes a booking for a particular area and connects them with others traveling there too.
